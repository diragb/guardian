# 🛡️ **Guardian**
There is an impostor among us. **Can you help us find out who it is?**

# ⚙️ Installation and Usage
Make sure to install **[Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)** before running the script. A Zoom Meeting needs to be running on the foreground.
Set the path of the installed Tesseract-OCR Executable.
```py
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe'
```

# 👀 Sussy Baka Analysis (SBA)
🛡️ **Guardian** uses state-of-the-art, proprietory technology known as SBA or SB Analysis. Used by experts worldwide (although with varying terms), SBA prevents impostors from joining a Zoom call by constantly monitoring the **SusTag**-s of all the participants, a 3-4 letter code that uniquely identifies each one of them.

If it notices any participant without a designated, predefined **SusTag**, or with a copied/invalid **SusTag**, it immediately kicks/permamutes that participant (depending on setting), and will also inform chat about *The Impostor* if asked.
